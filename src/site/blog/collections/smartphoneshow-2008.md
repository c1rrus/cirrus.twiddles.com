In 2008, while working for Symbian Software, I attended the Symbian Smartphone Show in London. I was one of the staff on Symbian's stall presenting tech demos to the punters. Between shifts I got to roam the rest of the show and blog about what I found on an event blog setup by Symbian's marketing team.

This collection contains copies of all the posts I contributed to that blog.
