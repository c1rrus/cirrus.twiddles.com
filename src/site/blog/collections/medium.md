Before I added a working blog section to this site, I used Medium for a few years. Now that I have my own blog, I'm replicating those posts here and making _these_ ones the canonical ones. A kind of retroactive [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) if you will.

Note, most of these posts there related to work I was doing at Buildit (the part of Wipro Digital I was working in at the time) and were contributed to Buildit's Medium publication (which no longer exists). If you prefer, you can view just those posts by themselves in the [Buildit collection](/blog/collections/buildit/).
