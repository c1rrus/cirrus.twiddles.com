I've just finished copying [a batch of old blog posts covering the Symbian Smartphone Show 2008](/blog/collections/smartphone-show-2008/) to this blog. That's all 25 posts I contributed to the [original Smartphone Show blog](https://smartphoneshow.wordpress.com/).

As with [the Mobile World Congress posts I previously copied here](/blog/2020/09/07/added-mwc-2008-posts/), I've replaced broken links with ones to Internet Archive copies, and set an appropriate `<link rel="canonical" href="...">` on each post, to acknowledge that these are re-published posts and not the originals. I've also kept the original, low resolution by today's standards images for now. Perhaps, I'll replace ones where I still have the originals with higher quality ones some day.

It's been fun and interesting to revisit those old memories. Tech which was novel at the time &mdash; like [zero shutter lag photography](/blog/2008/10/27/imaging-demo-details/), [location services](/blog/2008/11/03/lbs-demo/) or a [sound equaliser](http://localhost:8080/blog/2008/11/03/qsound-audio-demo/) &mdash; are now commonplace on smartphones 15 years later. Considering that the hardware of the day was _way_ more constrained than even a modest smartphone of today, I'm quite impressed that we were able to deliver that kind of functionality. Symbian OS was notoriously tricky to develop for (and I have no doubt that was one of the factors that contributed to its demise), but it sure was nippy!
