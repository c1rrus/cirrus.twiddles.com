_...you wait for ages and then two come along at once!_

That's right folks, I finally pulled my finger out and added a feed to this website &mdash; in _two_ formats: [RSS](/feed.rss) and [Atom](/feed.atom). You can now subscribe to [my blog](/blog/) in your favourite feed reader.

I link to them from the `<head>` of this site's pages too, so most feed readers should be able to auto-discover them from the URL of any page on this site too.

While I was at it, I also made a few minor cosmetic updates:

* Increased the body font size to whatever your system's default font size is (usually 16px), as text was looking a bit too small on systems that didn't have Verdana and thus fell back on their browser's default font.
* Changed the body font from Verdana to whatever your system's default sans-serif font is. Verdana was a look a bit too big and wide for my liking. Until I get around to a more substantial design refresh, I figured I'd just use your system's default font. They tend to be pretty legible.

Hope you like it. And _don't forget to mash that [subscribe button](/feed.rss)!_ :-P
