Hello readers, it's James here. After [infiltrating Symbian's Mobile World Congress blog](/blog/2008/01/30/demo-teaser/) earlier this year - I've been asked to come back and wreak some havoc here on the Smartphone Show blog for our 2008 show (yay!). Symbian blogging veteran William Carnegie will of course be back too, armed with his latest camera phone and witty headlines.

This year's [Smartphone Show](https://web.archive.org/web/20080830092401/http://www.smartphoneshow.com/) will be held at Earls Court 2 (we got too big for the Excel Centre!) on 21. & 22. October and promises to be the best one yet. It's free and anyone can register so please come and join us. Whether you work in the mobile industry, develop on Symbian OS, run a mobile-oriented blog or are just keen to see the latest flashy gizmos there will be something for everyone! (...and quite possibly [free coffee](https://smartphoneshow.wordpress.com/2007/10/17/goes-of-the-bean/) too!)

For those who can't make it, William and I will try to bring you the most interesting, amusing and weird highlights of the show right here on this blog. So, make a note in your calendar, bookmark this blog, subscribe to the RSS feed and tell your friends!

(Btw, I know the banner above still has last year's dates, but fear not - it will be updated in due course!)
