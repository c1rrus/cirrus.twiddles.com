After the success of the [Symbian @ MWC WidSets widget](/blog/2008/02/06/wicket-widsets-widget/) earlier this year, I have decided to make a [widget for this blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20081010094634/http://www.widsets.com/widget/366759581/):

Simply add it to your library in [WidSets](https://web.archive.org/web/20081010094612/https://www.widsets.com/) and youâ€™ll get all the latest posts to this blog straight to your mobile. Enjoy!

It's incredibly simple to create basic RSS-feed-monitoring widgets like this on WidSets. It took me all of five minutes to <del>knock this one up</del> <ins>lovingly craft</ins> this one! If you have a blog, photo / video sharing account or anything else that produces an RSS feed that you'd like to make available to mobile users then I suggest giving it a go.
