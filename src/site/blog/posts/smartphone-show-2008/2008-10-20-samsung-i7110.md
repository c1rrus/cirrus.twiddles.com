The show hasn’t even started properly and already we have a new phone annoucement! Samsung have just [announced the i7110](https://web.archive.org/web/20081023030043/http://press.samsungmobile.com/press.view.do?messageId=485) (there is also an [additional press release](https://web.archive.org/web/20081021143144/http://www.symbian.com/news/pr/2008/pr200810130.html) on symbian.com). It’s a very stylish looking S60 3.2 (which is built on Symbian OS 9.3) candybar.

Here are some of the highlights from the spec sheet:

- OLED QVGA screen
- 5MP camera (with face-detection & VGA video recording)
- Optical mouse (just like on the [Innov8](https://web.archive.org/web/20081029221419/http://uk.samsungmobile.com/mobile/GT-I8510) – very cool for web-browsing)
- FM transmitter (useful for music playback on car stereos)
- 12.9mm thickness

Of course it has all the usual trimmings you’d expect from a contemporary Symbian OS phone: GPS, FM radio, accelerometer, Webkit-based S60 browser, HSDPA, audio/video playback, etc. etc. 😉

Nice one Sammy, keep ’em coming! 감사합니다  ^_^
