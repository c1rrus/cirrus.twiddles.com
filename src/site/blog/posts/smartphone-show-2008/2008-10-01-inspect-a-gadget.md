One of the great things about the Smartphone Show is that you get play with lots of cool gadgets. Mostly it's the latest and greatest (in the past some devices were even premiered at the show - for example the [original E-Series trio](https://web.archive.org/web/20081001140459/http://www.symbian.com/news/cn/2005/cn20053180.html)) but occasionally you can also find curious or rare devices too. It's also a chance to sample phones from around the world that you wouldn't otherwise see in Europe (such as the [Japanese DoCoMo phones](https://www.flickr.com/photos/james_nash/tags/docomo/)).

No doubt there'll be plenty of cool stuff on display this year so if, like me, you're a bit of gadget freak it's well worth a visit (and don't forget [it's freeee](https://web.archive.org/web/20081004033022/http://www.smartphoneshow.com:80/page.cfm/Action=PreReg/PreRegID=1/t=m/)!). To get you in the mood here's a small selection of phones I snapped at last year's show:
