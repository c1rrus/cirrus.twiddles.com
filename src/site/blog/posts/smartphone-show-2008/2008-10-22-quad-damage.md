There a few stands (Symbianâ€™s included) showing off Symbian OSâ€™s SMP (**S**ymmetrical **M**ulti-**p**rocessing) support. Weâ€™ve announced [SMP support](https://web.archive.org/web/20080912050714/http://www.symbian.com/symbianos/os_smp.html) some time ago but this is the first weâ€™ve publically shown Symbian OS actually running on multi-core hardware. The hardware in question is rather beastly actually, boasting four ARM11 cores each running at several hundred MHz! (for comparison a [Nokia N95](https://web.archive.org/web/20080222100230/http://developer.nokia.com/devices/N95) has a single ARM11 core at 332MHz)

The plan is to optimize for power consumption. X cores running at Y MHz each consume less power than one core running at X * Y MHz so you can potentially get a lot of performance without killing the battery! Furthermore, individual cores can be powered down when not in use further saving power. A lot of the time a phone will be your pocket not doing very much, so a just single core can be kept switched on to keep things ticking over. When you then take your phone out to play games / watch videos / browse the Web it can switch on more cores as and when it needs them. All in the blink of an eye!

I canâ€™t wait for the day when this finds its way into real phones and I can run [Quake](https://web.archive.org/web/20080912045513/http://koti.mbnet.fi/hinkka/) on it to dish out some serious quad damage! ðŸ˜‰

Welcome to the future!
