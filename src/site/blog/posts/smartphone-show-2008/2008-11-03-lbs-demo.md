**Location Based Services** (or LBS for short) is another technology Symbian was demoing at the Smartphone Show. Specifically, we had a demo application that was showing how the LBS system within Symbian OS can use a variety of technologies to find out where you are and then make that information available to applications on the device.

Our demo used a variety of methods to locate itself on a map (the map data was provided by Open Street Map):

* **Cell-ID & last known position within that cell**. This least accurate but also the fastest method (and requires no extra power assuming that your phone is not in flight mode). It’ll tell you roughly which part of a town you’re in and is useful if you just want a map of your surroundings (perhaps to see what places of interest are nearby or to get a local weather forecast).

* **WiFi positioning**. This method uses a locally stored database of WiFi MAC addresses and their locations (though there’s no reason this couldn’t be updated via the internet). In built-up areas where there are lots of WiFi hotspots it can narrow down your location to the building you’re in and do so pretty quickly (within 5 seconds). This would be accurate enough to show you roughly where you are on a map (for example which street you’re on).

    The underlying implementation in this demo was provided by [Skyhook Wireless](https://www.skyhook.com/), but the LBS framework in Symbian OS is extendable so this could be replaced or augmented by other implementations (potentially user-installable ones too!). Interestingly this is not limited to WiFi positioning – you can use any method you like!

* **A-GPS**. Finally, the good ol’ GPS that we all know and love. The most accurate but also the slowest when it comes to getting a fix on your location. In this case the GPS is assisted not only by the cell ID but also the WiFi positioning. When used in our office (in a room with thick stone walls and tall buildings outside) this combination managed to get a GPS fix within about 15 seconds despite the very weak satellite signal.

    Apart from pinpointing where you are down to a few metres, GPS is useful when your location needs to be tracked. For example for turn-by-turn directions.

Positioning on phones isn’t really a new thing, but the nifty part is LBS framework can take care of choosing or combining different positioning technologies for you. It can trade off power-consumption and speed versus accuracy depending on the application and it can combine inputs from various methods to get a quicker or more accurate lock on your location. And since it’s built right into the OS all applications can take advantage of it.

If you happen to have SDN++ access, you can find a video of the demo and some additional information on the [Smartphone Show page](https://web.archive.org/web/20071130011357/http://developer.symbian.com/login.action) there (SDN++ log-in required).
