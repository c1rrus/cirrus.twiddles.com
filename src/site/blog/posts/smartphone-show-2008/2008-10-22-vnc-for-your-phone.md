[RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/) are showing off a mobile version of their software which comes in both S60 and UIQ flavours. This nifty app lets you see and control your mobile phone screen on a PC (via a network connection like 3G or WiFi). It also works the other way around, i.e. remote controlling your PC from your phone.
