Hello again peeps! I've set up a [Flickr group](https://www.flickr.com/groups/smartphone_show_2008/) where that you can all send your photos from the show to. You should be able to join right away (if there's any problems then please let me know). There's no strict moderation but please stick to its intended use and only add photos that relate to this year's Smartphone Show to the pool.

Enjoy!
