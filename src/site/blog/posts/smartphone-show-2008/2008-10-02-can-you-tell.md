Hehehe! I've been sneaking around Symbian HQ [again](/blog/2008/01/30/demo-teaser/) and have some **exclusive spy shots** of one of our Smartphone Show demos! I'm not allowed to give any more details but I can tell you that this is one (or is it?) of many technology demos we will be showing off this year...
