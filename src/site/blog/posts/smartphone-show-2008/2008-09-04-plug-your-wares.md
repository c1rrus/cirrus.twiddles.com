[SymbianOne](https://web.archive.org/web/20130704192812/http://www.symbianone.com/content/view/5691/108/) is reporting about the [SpeedNet@DevFest](https://web.archive.org/web/20080904084726/http://www.smartphoneshow.com/page.cfm/Action%3DForm/FormID%3D7/t%3Dm) event which will be taking place at the Smartphone Show. Basically, any Symbian OS app developer who feels up to the challenge can apply to do a 5 minute pitch of their app in front of a panel of key handset vendors, network operators and Symbian representatives. (Who knows, perhaps we'll sneak in and post the highlights to this blog too!)

It's a great opportunity to get some publicity for your apps as well as feedback from some industry big-wigs. So, if you're a developer head on over the Smartphone Show site and register your pitch!
