Nokia is organising another one of their legendary "[An Evening with S60](https://web.archive.org/web/20090202113102/http://blogs.s60.com/2008/09/an-evening-with-s60-touches-down-in-london)" events on the eve of the Smartphone Show, Monday 20. October. They did one last year which was a lot of fun: Nice venue, interesting people and great goody bags (containing a Bluetooth headset!).Â I'll definitely be attending again this year. If you want to come along too you'd better [sign up](https://web.archive.org/web/20090321033019/http://www.s60.com/events/login.do?landing=eventPage.do) pronto - spaces are usually limited.

The Smartphone Show veterans amongst you may recall another event that is traditionally held on the night before the Smartphone Show: [All About Symbian](http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/)'s Pub Meet. Well, fear not! You won't need to choose between the two as [AAS are postponing their Pub Meet](http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/news/item/8096_Evening_with_S60_in_London.php) to a later date so as not to clash with Nokia's event.

I look forward to meeting some of you on the 20th!
