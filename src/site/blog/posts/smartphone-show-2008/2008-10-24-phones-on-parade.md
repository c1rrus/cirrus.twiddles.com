[As expected](/blog/2008/10/01/inspect-a-gadget/), many Symbian-OS phones were on display at the show. I snapped a few and have uploaded them for your viewing pleasure (you can click the images to see higher resolution versions)â€¦

**Various S60 phones on the S60 stand** (Including the new [5800 XpressMusic](https://web.archive.org/web/20081006174049/http://www.forum.nokia.com/devices/5800_XpressMusic) with S60 5th edition)

**Some pretty Korean models** ðŸ˜‰

â€¦and finally, a classic: **The Ericsson R380**, the first phone to use Symbian OS (or Epoc as it was back then)
