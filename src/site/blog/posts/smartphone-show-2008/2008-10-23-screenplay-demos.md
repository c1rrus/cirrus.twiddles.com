This year we had two [**ScreenPlay**](https://web.archive.org/web/20081015025015/http://www.symbian.com/symbianos/os_screenplay.html) demonstrations at the Smartphone Show. One was a fancy image gallery with hardware-accelerated [OpenVG](https://www.khronos.org/openvg/) graphics (this was running on a [TI OMAP 3430](https://web.archive.org/web/20080922070519/http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/wtbu/wtbuproductcontent.tsp?templateId=6123&navigationId=12643&contentId=14649) development board). The gallery was populated with [photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/30945601@N03/) from our [imaging demo](/blog/2008/10/27/imaging-demo-details/). It also had a transparent incoming call dialog window that could appear to demonstrate the surface composition effects of ScreenPlay. Pretty nifty!

(Btw, our [SMP demos](/blog/2008/10/22/quad-damage/) were running a non-hardware-accelerated version of this)

Additionally we had a second ScreenPlay demo showing a basic UI that had been enhanced with various transition effects (menus and windows zooming and fading in and out).
