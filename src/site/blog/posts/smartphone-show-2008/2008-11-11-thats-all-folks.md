It’s taken a little while (Sorry, but I do still have a day job…) but I’ve now posted all the material I wanted to about the **Smartphone Show 2008**. I think William’s finished [uploading photos](https://smartphoneshow.wordpress.com/category/smartphone-show-2008/photos/) too so that about wraps up our coverage of this year’s show. (Btw, I’m pleased to see that others joined in sharing their [Smartphone Show photos](https://flickr.com/groups/smartphone_show_2008/pool/) too! If you still have a few lurking around on your harddrive why not join in and add them to [our Flickr group](http://flickr.com/groups/smartphone_show_2008/)!)

With a bit of luck our posts on the various **Symbian OS** demos will have given you a glimpse of what you can expect from your phones in the future.


- [**ScreenPlay**](/blog/2008/10/23/screenplay-demos/): Whizzy graphics support for the fancy UIs and apps of tomorrow.
- [**Symmetrical Multi Processing**](/blog/2008/10/22/quad-damage/): Immense processing power when you need it and clever power savings when you don’t.
- [**Location Based Services**](/blog/2008/11/03/lbs-demo/): Doing whatever it takes to get you to your destination.
- [**VCC using FreeWay**](/blog/2008/11/11/vcc-demo/): Keeping you connected at all times.
- [**Audio Demo**](/blog/2008/11/03/qsound-audio-demo/): Is that a home cinema in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
- [**Imaging Demo**](/blog/2008/10/27/imaging-demo-details/): Taking pictures before you even knew you wanted to take them!

We hoped you enjoyed the show! We’re always keen to hear your feedback, so if you’ve got any thoughts or suggestions please post them below in the comments.

With a bit of luck we’ll be back next year, so keep this blog in your bookmarks and news readers! See you then! Have a good’un!
