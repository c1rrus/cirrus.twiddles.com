While working at Wipro Digital I contributed a few posts to their blog. They're mostly about web design and one about [Atomic Design](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/) (which was my gateway drug into the world of design systems!). Unfortunately, that blog no longer exists. It now redirects to another blog on Wipro's main website which doesn't contain those posts or any of the others from the early days of Wipro Digital.

Luckily, I was able to find copies via the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), so I've now re-published them here. I had been meaning to do that anyway, just as I've been doing with content I've posted to other blogs over the years.

Go ahead and browse [the collection of my Wipro Digital blog posts](/blog/collections/wipro-digital/). I hope you enjoy them!
