Sorry for not posting anything yesterday. The app I was going to use on my phone had trouble connecting and the WiFi connection in my hotel room wasn't working either. \*grumble\*

Yesterday was a blast! I spent most of the day on the Symbian stand showing off one of our two ScreenPlay demos (I'll cover it in more detail in a later post). Lots of people came by and seemed to be interested (though I suspect some were just after the coffee!). There were a few bloggers stopping by too - one was from the [Mobile Game Developer Magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20080213151617/http://www.mobilegd.com/news/) which looks like an interesting site for... well... mobile game developers. We also had Norman from [Symbian World](https://symbianworld.wordpress.com/) stop by - another interesting blog worth checking out! I wonder if the [AAS](http://www.allaboutsymbian.com/) boys or some of the [blogs.S60.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20080706085840/http://blogs.s60.com/) folk will stop by too - come on guys, you know you want to!

In the evening there was the Symbian party which was excellent. There was plenty of food and drink and music by the [Pinker Tones](https://www.thepinkertones.com/). I would say it was kind of funky electro music, but I'm not too good with the old music genres, so [why not judge for yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNMEdBhvHK8)? In any case it was a lot of fun and we were dancing away (especially William ;-) ) into the wee hours of the morning.

Right, best be off to the show now.
