The MWC hasn't officially opened yet and two of our licensees have already announced new devices using Symbian OS. Joy!

**Sony Ericsson** has shown off two new [UIQ](https://web.archive.org/web/20080212155246/http://www.uiq.com/uiqplatform.html) / Symbian OS devices: The [G700](https://web.archive.org/web/20080428080042/http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/g700?cc=gb&lc=en) and [G900](https://web.archive.org/web/20080409233619/http://www.sonyericsson.com/cws/products/mobilephones/overview/g900?cc=gb&lc=en). Both are very slinky (13mm thick) candy-bar phones with touchscreens, 3G and decent cameras. In the case of the G900 it's a very decent camera: 5MP with auto-focus! How on earth did they cram that into such a thin package?

G700:

**LG** have just announced their KT610. It's running [S60](https://web.archive.org/web/20080517094415/http://www.s60.com/) 3rd edition Feature Pack 1 (which is built on Symbian OS 9.2). It features GPS, HSDPA (3.6Mbps), QWERTY keyboad and a 2.4" QVGA screen. Sweet! Unfortunately there don't seem to be photos available just yet, but fear not -as soon as I finish my morning shift at the Symbian stand I'll head over to LG and snap some... well, unless William beats me to it!
