I’ve knocked up a quick’n’dirty widget on [WidSets.com](https://web.archive.org/web/20080206164315/https://www.widsets.com/) which lets you monitor the latest posts to this blog:

“But what on earth are widgets and WidSets and why are they wicked?” I hear you ask. Well, widgets are generally miniature programs that perform a specific task (often they monitor something like weather, stock prices or a blog) which run within a bigger program called the [widget engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_engine).

WidSets is a widget engine written in Java that runs on mobile phones (including, of course, many Symbian OS-based ones :P). It’s free to download, straight-forward to use and, as I have now discovered, making your own widgets is a piece of cake too!

So, now that you’re all clued up and raring to go, why not install [our little widget](https://web.archive.org/web/20080512091619/http://www.widsets.com/widget/181381079/) on your phone so that you can keep up to date with all the events of next week wherever you are...
