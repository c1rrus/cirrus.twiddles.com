[As promised](/blog/2008/02/11/off-to-a-rolling-start/), I've snapped a few piccies of LG's new S60 handset. It's a very unique design - on the outside it looks like a classy but retro handset with just basic buttons and a small display...

...however open it up and you have a mini communicator! Full QWERTY keyboard, landscape screen and stereo speakers! Pretty nifty!

Btw, it seems there was a typo in the press release and itâ€™s main screen is the usual **Q**VGA resolution, not VGA.
