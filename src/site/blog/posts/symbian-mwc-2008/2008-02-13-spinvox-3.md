William may have beat me to it, but I'm still going to post about [SpinVox](https://web.archive.org/web/20080213023346/http://www.spinvox.com/). I think [his photo](https://symbianmwc08.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/spinvox/) just didn't capture the enormity of their menacing army of box-headed action men...

Also, I just want to brag about the fact that I got a full-size manniquin and not just a [puny keyring](https://symbianmwc08.wordpress.com/2008/02/13/spinvox-2/). Mwuharharharrr!

I wonder if Symbian should build an army of figurines with our OS cube as heads. Hmmm....
