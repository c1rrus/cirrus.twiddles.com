Mobile World Congress 2009 is almost upon us. The [Symbian Foundation](https://web.archive.org/web/20090318162207/http://www.symbian.org/) will have a stand with some fun demos (and free coffee!) so please pop by and say hello! They have also set up a [Symbian Foundation Blog](https://web.archive.org/web/20090218131441/http://blog.symbian.org/) where they will be posting news and coverage from the show.

Please go visit it, bookmark it, subscribe to it and share it with the world!
