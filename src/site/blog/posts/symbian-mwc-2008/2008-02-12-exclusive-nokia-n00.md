There I was minding my own business on the [Nokia Siemens Networks](https://web.archive.org/web/20080908021246/http://www.nokiasiemensnetworks.com/) stand looking a DVB-H demo when I spotted this:

![A Nokia N96 phone showing "N00" as its model number](/media/symbian-mwc-2008/n00.jpg)

This couldn't possibly be a prototype N96 from when they hadn't decided what the final model number would be. No, definitely not. The only logical explanation is that it's a Nokia device from the future when they've exhaustedÂ  all 2 digit numbers from N01 to N99 that has been sent back in time through a random wormhole and, purely by coincidence, happens to look exactly like an N96. Yes, that's got to be it.
