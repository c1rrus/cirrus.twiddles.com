I spent some time on the [NTT DoCoMo](https://www.nttdocomo.co.jp/) stand today. It's always fun to drool over the amazing devices and services they have over in Japan. Though it's then depressing to realise that we currently miss out on much of that stuff here in Europe. (Why I can't I do contactless payments with my phone yet, dammit!) Here are some photos of things that caught my attention...

[1seg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1seg) mobile TV phones with gorgeous WVGA (800x480) screens:

A phone together with objects that presumably inspired its design:

And of course, who can forget the classic waterproof phone demo:
