I’ve wanted to set up a [blog of my own](/blog/) for years. There are things about the Web, design, user experience, mobile technology and more that I have wanted to write about for a long time.

The reason I haven’t so far is that I had always intended to build my own, bespoke blogging platform to do it. The trouble is, I never actually made the time to go ahead and, y’know, _build_ it.

I still intend to build my own blog some day. Partly as a learning exercise, partly because it would be a fun project and partly because I would be able to keep it running for as long as I’m able to pay for a server. After all, online services have a habit of changing or disappearing altogether unfortunately. Remember [GeoCities](https://wiki.archiveteam.org/index.php?title=GeoCities)? [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader/)? [Orkut](https://www.orkut.com/)? You get the idea.

That being said, I have decided to give [Medium](https://medium.com/) a go as an interim outlet for my ramblings. If nothing else, I’ll get some practise at writing and maybe also some ideas for my own blog system.

Let’s see how it goes…
