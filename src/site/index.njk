		<h2>James Nash in a nutshell</h2>
		<p>Hi there! My name is <strong>James Nash</strong> and this is my personal website. It's primarily a place for me to share things I have made, am involved in or just find interesting with the world. Who knows, perhaps it will also let long lost acquaintances find me and get in touch.</p>
		<p>I chose the subtitle "<em>arty phone geek</em>" because it was the most concise summary of myself that I could think of:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>I like drawing, doing graphics on the computer and just generally making stuff that looks nice (amazingly, some people seem to think I'm good at it too! I'll let you <a href="/art/">judge for yourself</a> though).</li>
			<li>I like gadgets and gizmos, in particular mobile phones (it's like having all the other gadgets combined into one!).</li>
			<li>I consider myself a bit of <a href="http://catb.org/jargon/html/G/geek.html">geek</a> (when I'm not playing with phones, I'm often found mucking about on the computer).</li>
		</ul>
		<p>So there you go, that's me. I hope you enjoy the <a href="/blog/">blog</a>, <a href="/art/">art</a> &amp; <a href="/links/">links</a> sections of my site!</p>

Call me old-skool if you like, but I don't want every Tom, Dick and Harry seeing photos of me on a night out! :-P</p>
		<p>Oh yeah, incase you're wondering, I've not bothered with MySpace since I have a perfectly good "space" here (and one that doesn't look like someone barfed all over your browser either)!</p>

		<h2>About James Nash's site</h2>
		<p>The design you see before you now was released in 2009. It was the first major re-design of this site since this website launched in 2002. I lovingly hand-coded all the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/">CSS</a>. All the graphicswere made in <a href="https://www.gimp.org/">GIMP</a>.</p>
    <p>Originally, there was (very simple) a back-end written in <a href="https://www.php.net/">PHP</a> and it was all hosted on <a href="http://event-horizon.cyberfinity.net/">my own webserver</a> . However, as of June 2020 that setup has been replaced with an <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a>-powered static site build that gets deployed via <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.</p>

		<h2>James Nash's Work</h2>
    <p>I currently work in a design system team at a large investment bank. Previously I was a creative technologist for a large consultancy firm, a UX consultant and a mobile software developer. I live at the intersection of UX and technology and help people from each of those disciplines better collaborate.</p>
    <p><strong>Unless clearly stated otherwise</strong>, everything I say and write on this site and elsewhere online is my own, <em>personal</em> opinion and <strong>in no way represents the views of my past or present employers</strong>!</p>
		<p>To network professionally, please check out my: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamescnash" id="linkedin" rel="me">LinkedIn profile.</a> Please note that I usually only accept people as a new contact if I've actually met them in real life!</p>
		<h3>Shameless book plug</h3>
		<p>By the way, on the (increasingly unlikely) off chance that you're into developing multimedia apps for Symbian you may find this book useful:</p>
		<ul>
			<li id="mmbook"><a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Multimedia-Symbian-OS-Inside-Convergence/dp/0470695072/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1253820406&amp;sr=8-1">Multimedia on Symbian OS</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>I wrote one of the chapters for it, so it must be good! ;-)</p>

		<h2>Obligatory badges</h2>
		<p>No self-respecting geek's site would be complete without an assortment of badges, banners and obscure codes so here are mine:</p>
		<ul id="badges">
			<li><a href="/foaf.rdf" title="James Nash's FOAF file" id="foaf" class="small-button"><span>James Nash's FOAF file</span></a> (<a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/" title="What is the FOAF Project?">?</a>)</li>
			<li><a href="http://gmpg.org/xfn/" title="This site is XFN Friendly" class="small-button" id="xfn"><span>XFN Friendly</span></a></li>
			<li><a href="https://validator.w3.org/check?uri=referer" title="This page is valid XHTML" class="small-button" id="valid-xhtml"><span>Valid XHTML 1.0</span></a></li>
