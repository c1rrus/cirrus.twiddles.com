<h1>James Nash's homepage</h1>
<p>
Hi there! My name is <strong>James Nash</strong> and this is my personal website! It's very very
primitive at the moment. That's because I'm quite busy and don't have time to make anything better
:-(. Eventually I promise I will make a dead cool kick-ass, super-slick-XHTML-compliant website! you
just have to be (very) patient! :-/
<p>&nbsp<p>
<h2><a href="gfx/"><img src="pix.png" width="231" height="81" border="0" alt="Pictures"></a></h2>
<br>
Here's a <a href="gfx/">link to a folder where I keep all the pictures</a> I've made. Feel free to
download any ones you like! If you redistribute them or modify them tho just
make sure you acknowledge me
as the original artist! I do have the copyright on these, y'know! Anyway, it's not much to ask, is it?
<p>
There are some more pics over on <a
href="http://event-horizon.twiddles.com/sites/arty/outposts/">the
Outposts page</a>, which has a less naff layout!
<p>
Now there's even more pictures on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/james_nash/">Flickr
page</a>. Enjoy!

Well, since this is my <em>personal</em> site I might as well tell you all a little about myself! Here goes...<br>
</center>
<ul>
<li>My name is: James Nash<p></li>
<li>I currently live in South West London, England<p></li>
<li>I develop mobile phone software for a living<p></li>
<li>I'm an artist on the <a href="http://adonthell.linuxgames.com/">Adonthell project</a> -
an open-source RPG<p></li>
<li>I hope to start a little web design business at <a href="http://www.twiddles.com/">www.twiddles.com</a> in the distant future!<p></li>
<li>Here is my <a href="foaf.rdf">FOAF file</a>. (<a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/">Find out about FOAF</a>)<p></li>
<li>I <em>especially</em> like:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://yvette.twiddles.com/">My girlfriend Yvette</a></li>
</ul><p>
</li>
<li>...and I also quite like (in no particular order):
<ul>
<li>Drawing pictures</li>
<li>Chocolate</li>
<li>Malibu and Coke</li>
<li>Gizmos with flashing lights</li>
<li>Linux</li>
<li>Trance music</li>
<li>Chicken Korma</li>
</ul>
<p></li>
<li>I don't like (again in random order):
<ul>
<li>Bogroll that's been hung up the wrong way round</li>
<li>The noise a hoover makes</li>
<li>Raw onions</li>
<li>Shopping for shoes</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<center>
Well, that's about it for now! Thanks for stopping by! Check in a couple of hundred years and I might have added something to this page! :-P
<p>
Oh yeah, one last thing - incase you came across this page via some other site you might 
want to look at my <a href="http://event-horizon.kicks-ass.net/">Event-Horizon pages</a>. There's some
more fun stuff to  
be found there!
